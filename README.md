# C# Badge Maker

## Description

C# Badge Maker is a Command Line Application that allows users to generate Id badge pngs that include a workers name, id, and photo. It was built to learn C#.

While building this project I learned to:

- Write C# variables by defining what they are, for example instead of `var bl = true` you would write `bool bl = true`
- Install C# packages using `dotnet`
- Manipulate the file system to generate files and folders
- Import packages with the `using` tag. Primarily from the `System` but also from dotnet packages
- Run a C# file by using `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch`
